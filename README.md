## ⚠️ Currently not actively maintained

Hey! I created this project when I was dipping my toes into the world of web development. A lot has happened since then. Currently, this project is not actively maintained so I am going to archive it. Feel free to fork or take over it if you still want to maintain it. ✌️

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
